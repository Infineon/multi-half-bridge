### Supported Hardware Platforms

The library should be supported by any Arduino platform based on the reference Arduino cores. 

Check in this [link](https://github.com/Infineon/multi-half-bridge/wiki/Hardware-Platforms) the already verified (at least successfully built) platforms, and find out which boards are under CI build check [here](https://github.com/Infineon/multi-half-bridge/tree/master/.github/workflows).

### Getting Started

Find a getting started tutorial based on the DC Motor Control Shield for Arduino and the XMC4700 Relax Kit [here](https://github.com/Infineon/multi-half-bridge/wiki/Ino-Getting-Started).
