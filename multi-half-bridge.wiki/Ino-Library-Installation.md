The library can be installed in several ways:

* Arduino IDE Library Manager 
* Arduino IDE Import .zip library
* Arduino IDE manual installation
* PlatformIO

These installation process are conveniently described in the official Arduino [website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).

### Arduino IDE Library Manager

Library name: ```multi-half-bridge```

### Arduino IDE Manual Installation

Download the desired .zip library version from the repository [releases](https://github.com/Infineon/multi-half-bridge/releases) section.
 
:warning: As a general recommendation, downloading directly from the master branch should be avoided. Even if it should not, it could contain incomplete or faulty code.
